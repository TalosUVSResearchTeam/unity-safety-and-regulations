- ## About
This project is a game written in unity, which will teach users about the safety and regulations of UAVs. To be able to create this project, research should be done on regulations, on safety and to look if anything similar already exists. At the same time, they will need to find a way to integrate regulations and security into the game, so discussion on this is key. Students should become familiar with Unity by creating a game and following available tutorials.
